## 🧠 Project Overview
Between **April and July 2025**, NHS England managed millions of elective-care referrals under its *Referral to Treatment (RTT)* programme.  
This project builds a **fully automated analytics pipeline** that turns 77 million + rows of raw CSVs into clean, interactive insights.

### 💡 Tools
| Component | Technology Used |
|------------|----------------|
| Data Cleaning & Aggregation | Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) |
| Data Modelling | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS 2.0) |
| Visualization | Power BI |
| Dataset Source | NHS England RTT (Open Government Licence v3.0) |

---

## 🎯 Objective
To analyse NHS hospital waiting-time trends (Apr–Jul 2025), identify bottlenecks, and forecast demand — helping NHS leaders allocate capacity and reduce backlogs.

## 📚 Data Source
**Dataset:** NHS England — Referral to Treatment (RTT) Waiting Times for Consultant-Led Elective Care  
**Coverage:** April → July 2025  
**Publisher:** NHS England & Department of Health and Social Care  
**Licence:** [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

📦 **Total Records:** ≈ 77 million (~ 7 GB raw)

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Python)

**Notebook:** `nhs_waiting_Analysis.ipynb`  
**Final Output:** `NHS_waiting_times_cleaned.csv` (7.7 M rows × 4 columns)

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded four monthly CSV files using `glob` and merged them.  
2. Added a `Period` field extracted from file names.  
3. Selected core columns: `Period`, `Provider Org Name`, `WaitBand`, `Patients`.  
4. Transformed wide → long format via `pd.melt`.  
5. Replaced missing `Patients` values with 0 (no patients reported ≠ missing data).  
6. Grouped and classified wait-bands into four categories:  

| Wait Category | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| 0–18 Weeks | Met NHS target window |
| 18–52 Weeks | Medium delays |
| 52+ Weeks | Long waiters |
| Other | Unclassified / Incomplete data |

**Final shape:** `7.7 M rows × 4 columns`  
**Missing values:** 0

## 📊 Exploratory Analysis (Highlights)

### 🧩 Top Providers by Patient Volume
| Provider | Total Patients |
|-----------|----------------|
| Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust | 2,032,806 |
| Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust | 1,731,802 |
| Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust | 1,432,694 |
| Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust | 1,405,700 |
| Barts Health NHS Trust | 1,383,074 |

### Patients by Wait Category

	•	78% of records fall under “Other”, indicating unclassified or miscoded wait bands (major data-quality issue).
	•	17.6% waited 0–18 weeks
	•	4.2% waited 18–52 weeks
	•	Very small proportion waited 52+ weeks

> Around 78 % of all records fell under “Other,” due to unclassified bands — a key data-quality issue.
> 
Although the dashboard suggests performance distribution, nearly 78% of records fall into ‘Other’, which limits meaningful analysis. This highlights a significant data classification issue that needs addressing before drawing conclusions on waiting time performance
### 📈 Trend ( Apr → Jul 2025 )
- Steady increase in total patients  
- Short wait ( 0–18 weeks ) dominates volume  
- Long waits ( > 52 weeks ) stable → throughput resilience

## 🧾 Aggregation & ETL Rationale

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Raw 77 M+ rows (~7 GB) slows SQL & Power BI | Aggregated in Python to 7.7 M records |
| Missing bands mislead totals | Replaced NaN → 0 |
| Multiple WaitBand columns | Melted to long structure |
| Performance for Power BI | Loaded into SQL as views |

✅ **ETL Pipeline Summary**  
1. Extract – RTT CSV files (Apr–Jul 2025)  
2. Transform – Clean + Aggregate in Python  
3. Load – Store to SQL Server for Power BI

## 🧱 SQL Modelling (SSMS 2.0)

**File:** `nhs_waiting_times.sql`

| View | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `vw_Fact_PatientWaits` | Aggregated patients by Period + Provider + WaitCategory |
| `vw_Dim_Date` | Year, Month, and Formatted Period |
| `vw_Dim_Provider` | Unique Provider List |
| `vw_Dim_WaitCategory` | Standardized Wait Categories |

A simple **star schema** improves Power BI performance and simplifies joins for slicers and filters.
